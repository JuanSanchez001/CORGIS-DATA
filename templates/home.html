		<p>This data is from 2017 report where it covers approximately 2000 electric utilities with their demand, customer, revenue, and etc report.</p>
		<p> The source of the electricity.json file comes from <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/">The U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>.
        They collect, analyze, and disseminate independent and impartial energy information.
        They use the data to provide policy-independent data, forecasts, and analyses to promote sound policy making,
        efficient markets, and public understanding regarding energy, and its interaction with the economy and the environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In order to calculate and regulate this data each year, the EIA requires electric utilities to report and complete standardized surveys (i.e., forms) to collect information. 
	    They also use statistical modeling, and a combination of specific, standardized data collection forms and processing methods, 
        along with some third-party information in order to regulate their data. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/what-eia-and-what-does-it-do">(Source)</a></p>
		<br>
		<p>The Transportation section from the 2017 report does not contain any data which is mostly likely because these utilities do not offer transportation of electricity and therefore cannot gain revenue from it.</p>
